# Statistical modeling

I don't have the proper background or experience to be talking authoritatively
about any kind of statistical modeling. Most of my work has been descrpiptive
stats, along with making freq. tables and visualization.

I'd like a basic introduction of statistical modeling though, with things like

## Prediction error

* Type I/II
* Training vs. test data

## Methods

* K nearest neighbours
* Linear Regression
* Ridge/lasso elastic net regression
* Classification/regression trees
* Random forests
* Support vector machines
