# R Workshop Nuuk {-}

This is (meant to be) a website collecting course material and exercises for a 
series of workshops about R for data wrangling and analysis.

The site is still in its very early phase, and most of the chapters only have 
basic outlines for topics to be discussed. The hope is to provide a central hub
for texts, exercises, links, etc.

You're welcome to share the link with anyone, but expect things to change.
